# Co Location Quotient
Visual Studio project to calculate the co-location quotient and constrained co-location quotient for a set of categorized points. Requires a point shapefile containing your field with categories. Sample data included.

## Notes
This project was created to support research for the following two journal articles:

The code is not being actively maintained but was functional the last time it was tested.
